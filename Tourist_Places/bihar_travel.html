            <p>Country : India</p>
            <p>State : Bihar</p>
            <p>About : Lying in ruins, Navlakha Palace is situated in Rajnagar near Madhubani in Bihar. This palace was 
                built by Maharaja Rameshwar Singh and said to have suffered extensive destruction during an earthquake in
                 1934. No renovation was done after the destruction, thus this palace remains in ruins now. It is a royal 
                 palace and even though it has been damaged so much, one can still marvel at its architectural brilliance. The palace complex comprised of gardens, pond and temples.

            <p>Country : India</p>
            <p>State : Bihar</p>
            <p>About : An important Jain pilgrimage, Jalmandir is situated in Pawapuri, Bihar. Jalmandir has been revered 
                highly by Jain devotees as it is believed that it is the place where Lord Mahavira breathed his last in
                 500 BCE. It is reckoned to be the cremation ground for this last Tirthankara of Jain sect. The legend has
                  it that, the demand of Lord Mahavira’s ashes was so high that a large amount of soil had to be eroded 
                  from around the funeral pyre that a pond was created here. A white marble temple was constructed and it 
                  has remained an important Jain pilgrimage in Bihar.
